    <p>Easy egg muffins with spinach, mushrooms, and cheese.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cooking spray</li>
        <li>10 ounce (28g) frozen spinach</li>
        <li>4.5 ounce (127g) chopped mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>10 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/3 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375F (190C)</li>
        <li>Spray a 12-cup silicone muffin pan with cooking spray. 
            Divide spinach and mushrooms evenly among the muffin cups, filling each about 2/3 full. 
            Sprinkle 1 teaspoon mozzarella cheese on top. 
        </li>
        <li>Beat eggs and sour cream together until well combined. Season with salt and pepper. 
            Mix in Italian seasoning and garlic salt. Pour into muffin cups until almost full. 
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until muffins have risen, tops are lightly browned, and a toothpick inserted 
            into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Loosen muffins with a butter knife 
            and remove from the pan.
        </li>
